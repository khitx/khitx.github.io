This is my final project for the Object Oriented Ruby portion of the Full Stack Communitty Bootcamp online course.

My project is called eBooks.  eBooks is a small app that lists the books currently available on BookBub. The app starts with a list of books and their authors, then allows the user to select a book to get a description. The user can also regenerate the list at any time.

The video demonstrating its use can be found here: [https://github.com/khitx/cli-data-gem-assessment-cb-000/blob/wip/cli%20data%20gem%20project.mov.zip](http://)
